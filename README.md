# Encryption-with-Python

This project consists of two parts, each providing an opportunity to enhance problem-solving skills through different programming paradigms.

### Part 1: Recursive Reorderings

In the file `ps4a.py`, the first part of the project focuses on recursive problem-solving. The goal is to develop a recursive function that takes a string as input and identifies
all possible reorderings of its characters. This exercise encourages thinking about problems in a recursive fashion, leveraging the concept of reducing a 
complex problem to a simpler version of itself.

### Part 2: Object-Oriented Programming

The second part of the project introduces object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. Two separate files, ps4b.py and ps4c.py, demonstrate OOP concepts in different contexts. 

#### Part 2.1: Caesar/Shift Cipher (ps4b.py)

In ps4b.py, the focus is on implementing a Caesar/shift cipher using OOP. This involves creating a class with specific attributes and methods for manipulating them. 
The Caesar cipher is a classic encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.


#### Part 2.2: Simple Substitution Cipher (ps4c.py)

ps4c.py extends the OOP exploration by implementing a simple substitution cipher. This type of cipher involves substituting each plaintext character with another character based on a predefined mapping. 
The class encapsulates the necessary attributes and methods for performing the substitution.
